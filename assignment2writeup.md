# Group Project Proposal
Team members: Haoyue Ma, Nian liu, Zhiheng Yao
The main goal of this group project is to create a user friendly website. Our user will be anyone that is willing to participate to write as short as one sentence to be a part of building a complete story. This game is easy to understand and contribute, it provides a platform where people can simply join and communicate. Potentially, markdown and python will be used in the process and our proposed schedule are described in more details down below.


Specifically, HTML is supported in Visual Studio Code followed [VS HTML Language](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html) specification.

## Learning Goals
    We would like to practice the skills we learnt from class combining with adequate research in order to have an idea on how to build a website with python. Besides practicing machine learning skills, we would like to learn about communication and collaboration.

## Implementation Plan
    The functions used for the website will be written in Python and supported with flask. Goal is to use our creativity combined with class materials to complete the task. Specific contents including website design, user interface, and demo of how to use the website will be included in this section of our project. For example, width, height, initial scale, inimum-scale. Deliver date is undetermined for the moment. Lastly, we will be sending invitations to friends and peers as test run. Iterations will be made accordingly based on our received feedbacks. 

## Project Schedule
    First week: Research about the progress and framework to use of building a website with python. Talk to the Professor about the idea.
    Second - third week: Build the website with the skills learnt
    Forth week: Mid-point check with Professor and solve the problems might face
    Fifth - sixth week: keep building the website
    seventh week:Test the project by sending invitation to Professor and friends and generate feedbacks
    Last week: Finalize the project by solving the problems realized through the test

## Collaboration Plan 
    During the research phase we will all doing research and learning individually for efficiency. While we enter the Implementation process, we will come together and have meetings in order to finish the plan so that we can combine what we learn all together. We will have a team leader to ensure all the members are working and make decisions while we have different views. We will use the waterfall development method to ensure we are clear about what we are doing under each phase.

## Risks
    The biggest risk for us is that we have no experience with html so we will need to do a lot of research and experience several times of faliures in order to implement the project. 

## Addition Course Content
    I think the class should cover the topic of slack and html so that we will have a better knowledge on the tools we will need to use for the project.
